# Format: comma-separated filter types (0=Kalman, 1=Low-Pass, 2=Mode, 3=Derivative, 4=2-Pole LPF)

# Racing Mode Filter Chain Configuration (used when race_mode=1)
# Optimized for low latency and fast response

# Kalman Filter Parameters
# Process variance - how much the signal is expected to change (lower = more stable)

# PID Controller Parameters
# Proportional gain - immediate response to error (higher = more aggressive)

# Derivative gain - reduces overshoot and oscillation (higher = more damping)

# Signal Sampling Configuration
# Number of frames between signal readings (higher = less CPU usage, lower = more responsive)
# At 120 FPS: 1=120Hz sampling, 2=60Hz, 3=40Hz, 5=24Hz, 10=12Hz

# Emergency Cooldown Configuration
# Time between bitrate decreases (lower = faster response to signal drops)

# For ultra-low latency racing, use 8-25ms (1-3 frames)

# Control Algorithm Configuration
# 0 = PID Controller (smooth transitions, more complex)
# 1 = Simple FIFO (fast, direct, more performant)
# Default: 1 (Simple FIFO for better performance)
