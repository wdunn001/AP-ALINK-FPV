# WIFI POWER MANAGEMENT
# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL: Disable WiFi power saving for FPV stability
# Both RTL8812AU and RTL8812EU drivers have power management features that
# cause connection instability during dynamic activities (flying, racing, etc.)
# 
# Power management affects:
# - Connection stability during movement
# - Packet loss during power state transitions
# - Latency spikes when resuming from sleep
# - Overall FPV video quality and responsiveness
#
# Set to 0 to disable power saving (RECOMMENDED for FPV)
# Set to 1 to enable power saving (NOT RECOMMENDED for FPV)
#
# The system will:
# 1. Use 'iw wlan0 set power_save off' for runtime control
# 2. Attempt to reload driver with power management disabled
# 3. Provide manual configuration instructions if automatic setup fails

# =============================================================================
# PIT MODE - LOW POWER STANDBY WITH HTTP WAKE-UP
# =============================================================================
# PIT mode provides low power standby for battery conservation during
# racing events or standby periods, while maintaining HTTP responsiveness
# for quick activation via web interface or mobile app
#
# Set to 0 to disable PIT mode (full power FPV mode)
# Set to 1 to enable PIT mode (low power standby with HTTP wake-up)
#
# PIT Mode Features:
# - Low power WiFi state for battery conservation
# - HTTP API remains responsive for wake-up calls
# - Quick transition back to full power FPV mode
# - Perfect for racing events with standby periods
#
# HTTP API: GET /api/toggle/pitmode - Toggle PIT mode on/off

# SIGNAL PROCESSING & FILTERS
# =============================================================================

# Filter Chain Configuration
# Format: comma-separated filter types (0=Kalman, 1=Low-Pass, 2=Mode, 3=Derivative, 4=2-Pole LPF, 5=Mean, 6=Gaussian)
# Examples: "0" (single Kalman), "2,0" (Mode->Kalman), "1,4" (Low-Pass->2-Pole LPF), "5" (Mean only), "6" (Gaussian only)
# Note: Mean filter (5) provides simple moving average - good for basic noise reduction
# Note: Gaussian filter (6) provides bell-curve weighted average - smooth noise reduction with center emphasis
# Default: "0" (Kalman filter - optimal for FPV applications)
rssi_filter_chain=0
dbm_filter_chain=0



# Low-Pass Filter Settings (used by filter types 1 and 4)
lpf_cutoff_freq=2.0

# Kalman Filter Parameters
# Process variance - how much the signal is expected to change (lower = more stable)

# SIGNAL SAMPLING & TIMING
# =============================================================================

# RSSI Reading Method
# 0 = Memory mapping (mmap) - Faster, uses less CPU, but may not work on all systems
# 1 = File rewind - More compatible, slightly higher CPU usage
# Default: 0 (memory mapping)
rssi_read_method=1
# Frame Sync Removed
# Bitrate control is independent of video frame rate
# There's no benefit to syncing WiFi changes with video timing

# Startup Delay (seconds)
# Delay before starting main control loop to allow SSH connections
# Higher values = more time for SSH, longer startup time
# Default: 5 seconds
startup_delay_seconds=5

# Signal Sampling Configuration
# Number of frames between signal readings (higher = less CPU usage, lower = more responsive)
# At 120 FPS: 1=120Hz sampling, 2=60Hz, 3=40Hz, 5=24Hz, 10=12Hz
signal_sampling_interval=5

# Independent Signal Sampling Frequency (Hz)
# This allows signal sampling independent of frame rate for better responsiveness
# Higher values = more responsive to signal changes, more CPU usage
# Lower values = less CPU usage, less responsive to signal changes
# Recommended: 50-100Hz for racing, 20-50Hz for general use
signal_sampling_freq_hz=50

# Emergency Cooldown Configuration
# Time between bitrate decreases (lower = faster response to signal drops)

# For ultra-low latency racing, use 8-25ms (1-3 frames)

# TROUBLESHOOTING
# =============================================================================
# If you see RSSI=0 and VLQ=-1000%+ in debug output:
# 1. Check driver path exists: ls -la /proc/net/rtl88x2eu/wlan0/
# 2. If not found, try: wificard=8812au
# 3. Check alternative paths: ls -la /proc/net/rtl88xxau/wlan0/
# 4. Verify sta_tp_info file exists and contains RSSI data
# 5. Run: sudo ./ap_alink_debug to see diagnostic output
# 6. If WiFi enabled causes FPS drops, try: wifi_performance_mode=0
