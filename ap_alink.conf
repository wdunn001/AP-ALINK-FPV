# Filter Chain Configuration
# Format: comma-separated filter types (0=Kalman, 1=Low-Pass, 2=Mode, 3=Derivative, 4=2-Pole LPF)
# Examples: "0" (single Kalman), "2,0" (Mode->Kalman), "1,4" (Low-Pass->2-Pole LPF)

# Low-Pass Filter Settings (used by filter types 1 and 4)

# Kalman Filter Parameters
# Process variance - how much the signal is expected to change (lower = more stable)
kalman_rssi_process=0.00001
kalman_dbm_process=0.00001

# Measurement variance - how noisy the measurements are (higher = more noisy)

# Asymmetric Cooldown Parameters
# Minimum time between any bitrate changes (ms)
strict_cooldown_ms=200

# Additional time required before increasing bitrate (ms)

# Minimum percentage change required to trigger bitrate change

# PID Controller Parameters
# Proportional gain - immediate response to error (higher = more aggressive)

# Integral gain - eliminates steady-state error over time (higher = faster correction)
pid_ki=0.05

# Derivative gain - reduces overshoot and oscillation (higher = more damping)
